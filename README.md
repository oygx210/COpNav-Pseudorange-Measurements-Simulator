# COpNav-Pseudorange-Measurements-Simulator
Replicating results from "Observability Analysis of Collaborative Opportunistic Navigation With Pseudorange Measurements" paper. Here, an EKF-based estimator is used to simulator various observability scenarios for a vehicle moving in a unknown dynamic and stochastic envrionment.
